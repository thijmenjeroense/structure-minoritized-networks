	abstract = {Recent literature has reported a high percentage of asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic cases in subjects with {COVID}-19 infection. This proportion can be difficult to quantify; therefore, it constitutes a hidden population. This study aims to develop a proof-of-concept method for estimating the number of undocumented infections of {COVID}-19. This is the protocol for the {INCIDENT} (Hidden {COVID}-19 Cases Network Estimation) study, an online, cross-sectional survey with snowball sampling based on the network scale-up method ({NSUM}). The original personal network size estimation method was based on a fixed-effects maximum likelihood estimator. We propose an extension of previous Bayesian estimation methods to estimate the unknown network size using the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. On 6 May 2020, 1963 questionnaires were collected, 1703 were completed except for the random questions, and 1652 were completed in all three sections. The algorithm was initialized at the first iteration and applied to the whole dataset. Knowing the number of asymptomatic {COVID}-19 cases is extremely important for reducing the spread of the virus. Our approach reduces the number of questions posed. This allows us to speed up the completion of the questionnaire with a subsequent reduction in the nonresponse rate.},

	abstract = {In this article we develop a method to estimate both individual social network size (i.e., degree) and the distribution of network sizes in a population by asking respondents how many people they know in specific subpopulations (e.g., people named Michael). Building on the scale-up method of Killworth et al. (1998b) and other previous attempts to estimate individual network size, we propose a latent non-random mixing model which resolves three known problems with previous approaches. As a byproduct, our method also provides estimates of the rate of social mixing between population groups. We demonstrate the model using a sample of 1,370 adults originally collected by {McCarty} et al. (2001). Based on insights developed during the statistical modeling, we conclude by offering practical guidelines for the design of future surveys to estimate social network size. Most importantly, we show that if the first names asked about are chosen properly, the estimates from the simple scale-up model enjoy the same bias-reduction as the estimates from our more complex latent nonrandom mixing model.},

	abstract = {A compelling problem in a population is to estimate the number of people the average person knows. A consequential related problem is to estimate the size of important subpopulations. A random sample of a population is asked whether they know anyone in a given subpopulation of size e, thus yielding an estimate of the probability that this occurs in the population. Using an equal likelihood probability model, this leads to a lower bound estimate for c, the average number of people a person in the population knows. When the number of people a person knows has a binomial distribution over the population this value is an estimate for c itself. Here we test this method on data from Mexico City, where a large random sample of people was asked whether they knew anyone in each of several different subpopulations in Mexico City of known and unknown sizes. We develop procedures for obtaining various bounds and estimates for c and determine some of the respondents' attributes on which variation in probability of knowing someone in a subpopulation and variation in personal network size seem to depend. We apply these to the estimation of e for rape victims in Mexico City and the estimation of c from data on {AIDS} victims in the United States.},

	abstract = {Background and Objective: Due to the impact of risky behaviors in the community and the need for getting information and planning in this regard, the number of people with high-risk sexual behaviors in Isfahan will be indirectly estimated by the network scale-up method. 
Method: In a cross-sectional study conducted in June2018in14districts of Isfahan, a sample of1000 people was recruited by a non-random multistage method and interviewed using a standard questionnaire to identify people with high-risk sexual behavior. Data are analyzed based on a network scale-up method in the {STATA} application.
Results: According to a report by men, the prevalence of male Extra marital sexual relations (N=2437) and relation with paying prostituted women (N=1211), with non-paying prostituted women  (N=298), Homosexuality (N=696) and history of traveling for sexual relations (N =880/100,000); And according to a report by women, the prevalence of female Extra marital sexual relations (N=1386) and Sex Worker women (Monetary) (N=946), Sex Worker women (Non-Monetary) (N=258), and history of travelling for sexual relations (N=13/100,000). In both sexes, the age group of18 to 30years was more at risk for sexual behaviors than other groups 
Discussion and Conclusion: It seems that the prevalence of sexual high-risk behaviors in Isfahan is remarkable as the increased prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases, including {HIV}, but unfortunately, the required training is low in this regard, more attention should be paying to train people to prevent the prevalence of these high-risk sexual behaviors in society.},

Using two large datasets, for the {UK} and the Netherlands, covering the names of children born in the same family over a period of two decades, this paper seeks to identify clusters of names entirely inferred from common parental naming preferences. These name groups can be considered as coherent sets of names that have a high probability to be found in the same family. Operational measures for the statistical association between names and clusters are developed, as well as a two-stage clustering technique. The name groups are subsequently merged into a limited set of grand clusters. The results show that clusters emerge with cultural, linguistic, or ethnic parental backgrounds, but also along characteristics inherent in names, such as clusters of names after flowers and gems for girls, abbreviated names for boys, or names ending in –y or -ie.},
